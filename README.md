# DecentraRights

DecentraRights is an innovative, decentralized approach to participatory governance based on Ethereum blockchain technology. It aims to empower communities to define and manage their constitutional rights in a democratic, transparent, and secure manner.

## Overview 

At the core of DecentraRights is a token-based system built on Ethereum smart contracts. These tokens represent voting rights in a community. By holding tokens, members of the community can propose and vote on changes to their communal constitution. 

The system is designed to follow a path of least resistance, using a greedy algorithm to prioritize the most widely accepted constitutional rights. This ensures that the collective will of the community is always represented.

## Why DecentraRights?

- **Decentralization:** No central authority can control or manipulate the voting process.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency.
- **Security:** Ethereum's blockchain technology ensures the system is tamper-proof.
- **Community Empowerment:** Allows communities to self-regulate and define their own constitutional rights.
